# Flutter-Grocery-ui-app

The Store

## *Important*
Well, To be honest this is my first flutter App . I know it requires a lot of fixes. The code is total mess. I have taken alot of different repositories and tutorial and compiled one UI app. I have messed up alot with stateful and stateless widgets. I am still trying to adapt flutter.
### Refer this to undertand the difference between Stateful and Stateless widgets.

Some widgets are stateful, and some are stateless. If a widget changes—the user interacts with it, for example—it’s stateful. A widget’s state consists of values that can change, like a slider’s current value or whether a checkbox is checked. A widget’s state is stored in a State object, separating the widget’s state from its appearance. When the widget’s state changes, the state object calls setState(), telling the framework to redraw the widget.

A stateless widget has no internal state to manage. Icon, IconButton, and Text are examples of stateless widgets, which subclass StatelessWidget.

A stateful widget is dynamic. The user can interact with a stateful widget (by typing into a form, or moving a slider, for example), or it changes over time (perhaps a data feed causes the UI to update). Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField are examples of stateful widgets, which subclass StatefulWidget.
